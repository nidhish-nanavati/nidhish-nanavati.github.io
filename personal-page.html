                I believe that I am an enthusiastic and hardworking individual looking for the right opportunity to kickstart my career. The valuable experience that I was fortunate to gain during the endeavours of my previous company has made me the right fit for this job role of Mobile Engineer. I am thorough in the software development lifecycle as I have been utilising agile methodologies to drive feature implementation and continuous deployment while rapidly deploying applications from scratch to production. I was tasked with frequent email communication with clients and stakeholders to reciprocate about known issues and inquire about the progress and roadblocks along the way. I have also handled the web server functionalities for live websites on production and monitor logs as a part of some support tasks. I also got to work on the documentation of critical process workflows such as process flowcharts, designs and feature diagrams, and module integration models and implement it in the development lifecycle.I found ways to devise efficient algorithm creation techniques to apply on feature development by using the optimal data structure. It has also encouraged me to take a deep dive into the development of critical processes and paradigms. I have made long strides in the deployment processes and version controlling through Git, Jenkins and Maven pushing code and content to production frequently. My experience of developing complex modules coupled with the practicum training about various technologies stack used in projects that I received, have made me confident in taking up work on any technology stack and learning new technologies and processes at will. I also performed Search Engine Optimization using Google Tag Manager and Adobe Analytics to improve the reach and rank on Search engines through effective techniques along with writing automated scripts for functional and unit testing to automate the complete process of QA testing.

                All these experiences have made me an ideal individual that can carry out the required tasks with speed, efficiency, and accuracy. I believe that I possess the required experience to flourish in this job role because of the skills that I have harnessed, and the experience that I have gained as a result of working in a similar setting. It would be a pleasure to utilise my skills to be an invaluable part. Hopefully, looking forward to being considered in the recruitment pipeline and getting a response.
